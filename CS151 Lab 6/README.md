# Lab 6
Grade: EMRN 
Due: Before next lab

## Problem: 
You need to refactor the ATM application so that it has proper error checking and functions.

## Purpose: 
This lab gives you practice with:
* Designing and programming functions
* Re-using many of the other aspects of Python we've learned so far
* Testing code
* Using loops for error checking

## Details:
You need to refactor some example code from Lab 5 so that the following is true:
* It is now organized in functions
* If the user enters an invalid option they are prompted again, and this continues until they give a valid option
* If the user enters a negative number to deposit or withdraw, they are asked again, and this continues until they give a valid value
* If their balance becomes negative, alert the user it is negative and will be charged 5%.

## Steps:
We are going to practice "iterative development": focusing on one aspect of the problem first, then once that works, focusing on the rest of it.

1. Understand the problem
2. Look over the Lab6 version of the Lab5 code in replit.
3. Determine the functions that might make sense in the code. Take at most 10 minutes planning.
4. Re-arrange the code into functions without adding the new error checking.
5. Test that your code still works using the test cases you developed for Lab 5.
6. Design your error checking functions. Put these designs in algorithm.txt.
7. Write your code for the new error checking functions following your algorithm and using good usability principles. Incorporate them into your previously working code.
8. Properly comment your code with intro comments, function comments, and line comments
9. Write a set of testcases in testcases.xlsx to test your new functionality (your error checking). Your test cases from Lab 5 should be sufficient for testing in general, so focus on the new ones.



## Submit:
1. To Replit:
    1. Your Python file (main.py)
    2. Your algorithm (algorithm.txt)
       
 2. On Moodle:
    1. Reflection (1 per partner): Discuss what you learned in lab, what it was like working with your partner, and what it was like refactoring code like the code you wrote a few weeks ago? (.pdf, .docx, or .txt)
    2. Your test cases based on your flowchart (testcases.xlsx, 1 per pair)
