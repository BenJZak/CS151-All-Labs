# Lab 0 -- Getting Started with Python using Replit as cloud-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Graded: EMRN			

Due: Tuesday 9/12/23

## Purpose:  

This assignment is aimed at giving you experience with the lab environment, with pair programming, using the Replit IDE (Interactive Development Environment) and writing, debugging, and running a simple Python program.

## Problem: 

Write a program that introduces you and your partner to the class (this information will be shared). 

### Details: 

You will write your program in the “pair programming” mode -- one of you is the driver while the other is the navigator.  Once the first driver has written the statements about their partner, switch roles. Each member of the pair should bring up the code on their own computer. Remember that the navigator (e.g. the person not currently the driver) is helping with determining what code should be written. 

The first person copies or forks the Lab0 repl. The second person joins that repl.

### Steps:

#### Driver 1 creates the Repl and Navigator joins that Repl :

1.	TO RENDER THIS FILE: Click Tools on left then Markdown

2.	CODE: Write code in your main.py file. First type `print ("CS151 Lab 0")` into the file.

3.	RUN and TEST: Run your program by clicking on the “>Run” button. Note that once you complete this step your partner's screen will reflect the new code. Look at the output in the right panel. Does the output appear the way you want? If not, or if instead you see an error, try to fix your code so that it does what you want (you will need to run again afterward).

4. CONTINUE CODING: Now, write code to output the name of your partner, and then output 5 separate statements about your lab partner so that they also appear in the right panel when the file is run. Your lab partner (e.g. the current Navigator) should tell you want to write about them. 
  * Try to be creative in your statements. 
  * This step should involve 6 print statements.

5.	RUN and TEST: Run your code again and make sure it is working correctly, i.e. showing your partner's name and then the 5 separate print statements about them. 


#### Driver 2 Writes Code:

7. It is now driver 2's turn to write the code. 

8. You should see the main.py file that driver 1 created and the code still there from the prior steps. It is now time to write code about driver 1. Driver 2 should create 6 print statements: 1 that outputs the name of their partner, and the other 5 that each say something about driver 1. Driver 1 is now the navigator, and should supply the information to be added to the print statements.

9.  RUN and TEST: Run your program by clicking on the “>Run” button.  Look at the output of the code. Does it appear the way you want? If not, or if instead you see an error, try to fix your code so that it does what you want (you will need to run again afterward).

10.	COMMENT: Comments are part of the Python file but not part of the code. They are used to explain how the code works to human readers of the code.  Once your program runs properly, add introductory comments at the very top of your file that match the ones below but are edited to be personalized to you and your partner (**replace the brackets and the text in the brackets with what the text in the brackets asks for**). The comments will appear as a different color in Replit. Make sure the program runs correctly after the comments are inserted, and that you understand what is being said in each line of the comments.
  ```
  # Programmers:  [*BOTH* your names here]
  # Course:  CS151, Dr. Olsen or Dr. Kenyon or Mr. Nweke  
  # Due Date: 9/12/23
  # Lab Assignment: 0
  # Problem Statement:  Output information about the programmers
  # Data In: None, there is no user input in this program
  # Data Out:  The names of the programmers and five statements about each of them
  # Credits: [Is your code based on an example in the book, in class, or something else?  
              Reminder: you should never take code from the Internet or another person.]
  ```

11.	Once you are done in lab, even if you haven’t finished the assignment yet, you can always reopen Replit and edit further.

12. Show your program running and on Replit to the professor before leaving the classroom. If class is over yet you haven't finished, work on your own time. Finish before due date.
13. Click SUBMIT

### What to Submit:

1.	Save completed lab in Replit. It should include a main.py with all requested lines of code and the introductory comments at the very top. Check that it worked. (1 file per pair)
2.	Each partner should independently write a short (around 200 words) reflection of what they learned in Lab 0, and what it was like working with their partner. Submit a word document to Moodle under the Lab0 assignment.
