First we need to select a country. In this case, we will choose Pakistan. 
We then need to find the birth, death, and immigrant rates in Pakistan.

* There is a new birth every 12 seconds
* There is a death every 16 seconds
* Someone migrates out of the country every 200 seconds

We will have to ask the users the following inputs:

* The birthrate in terms of how many seconds between births
* The deathrate in seconds
* The rate of new immigrants in seconds
* The current population
* How many years into the future the user wants to know the population

Then make sure to convert the answer to an integer value
