Because there are going to be some complex calculations, we are going to need to import the math library to use the square root function

We will need a series of inputs:
  The hill type that the skier is jumping from
  The speed they are travelling at the end of the ramp
Given these inputs, we will predict how far they will jump, and then output the number of points they earned

Calculate the points if the hill is normal
if the hill is normal
  height is 46
  calculate airtime with the equation sqrt((2*height)/9.8)
  distance traveled is speed times airtime
  the points earned is 60 plus (distance minus par) * points per meter (2 for normal hill)  

Calculation for points if the hill is large
if the hill is large
  height is 70
  calculate airtime with the equation sqrt((2*height)/9.8)
  distance traveled is speed times airtime
  the points earned is 60 plus (distance minus par) * points per meter (1.8 for large hill) 

Depending on the points earned, output different statements to the user
if points is 61 or greater 
  output great job for doing better than par
otherwise, if points is less than 10
  output What happened?
otherwise
  output sorry you didn't go very far

output the points
