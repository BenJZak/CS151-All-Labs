Import math module
The first step of our program will be to gather the following inputs from the users:
  Ask them which mobile phone provider package the user is using and assign to variable 'package'
    Package Green
      49.99/month, 2GB data provided, $15/GB for additional data, coupon for -$20 available
    Package Blue
      70/month, 4GB data provided; 10/GB for additional data
    Package Purple
      99.95/month, unlimited data
Ask them how many GB of data they used
  Assign to float variable 'data_usage'
Assign float variable 'total_cost' to 0
Assign boolean variable 'coupon' to false
If package is green, ask user if they have a coupon and assign to boolean variable 'coupon'
  If data_usage is greater than or equal to 2, subract 2 from data usage and assign to 'total_cost', use ceiling function to round up and reassign, and multiply by 15. Reassign.
  Add 49.99 to 'total_cost'.
  If total is 75 or more and coupon is true, subract 20 from total.
Otherwise if package is blue,
  If data usage is greater than 4, subract 4 from data usage and assign to 'total_cost' use ceiling fuction to round up and reassign, multiply by 10 and reassign.
  Add 70 to total cost
Otherwise if package is purple, set 'total_cost' to 99.95
Otherwise tell the user that it was invalid and do not give them a bill amount or do any calculations
Output total, round total_cost using print f
